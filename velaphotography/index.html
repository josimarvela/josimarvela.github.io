    <p1 class='portraitparagraph'>Portraits are a great way to be able to show
        the personality of an individual and make them stand out. I take
        portraits because I want the people that come to me to take their portraits 
        to be able to feel confident in theirselves. And with enough effort 
        on my part we can make that happen.</p1>

    <p1 class='landscapeparagraph'>I am not just constrained to portraits! I very much enjoy
        taking landscape pictures as well. These are just some of
        the few landscape photos that I have taken and to show 
        that I also have skills in taking landscape pictures as well. Landscape
        photography is a great way to capture a moment of beauty, but 
        can also be very difficult to be able to grasp the whole
        beauty of it. I want to be able to share that beauty with everyone.

    <p1 class='miscellaneousparagraph'>These are just some of the pictures that I have taken
        that had caught my eye. I believe there is a photo to be
        taken everywhere you look. As long as there is light 
        a photo can and should be taken.
    </p1>
    <p2 class='miscellaneousquote'>"All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in
        another person’s (or thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely
        by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s
        relentless melt."
