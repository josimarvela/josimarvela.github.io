        <img src="images/josimar.jpg">
        <p1>My name is Josimar Vela and I am a 21 year old
            Mexican-American photographer who has been taking pictures for more 
            than 6 years now. I am from Dallas, Texas and I am 
            a triplet. I have an older brother and my triplet siblings
            are one boy and one girl. I enjoy taking pictures in my free time
            and I want to be able to share my pictures in magazine
            one day.
