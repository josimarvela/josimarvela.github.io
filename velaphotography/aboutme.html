            <p class="experienceparagraph"> I have been taking pictures since I was 15 years 
                old. I went to community college in Texas to get an associates
                degree in commercial photography. I have also had a year
                of photoshop and adobe lightroom. I have also been 
                able to take pictures for peoples birthdays and been 
                commissioned by more than 50 people from this year.
